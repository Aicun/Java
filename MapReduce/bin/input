Chinese New Year is an important Chinese festival celebrated at the turn of the traditional
 lunar Chinese calendar. It is also known as the Spring Festival. Celebrations traditionally 
 run from the evening preceding the first day, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of 
 the first calendar month. The New Year festival is centuries old and gains significance 
 because of several myths and traditions. Traditionally, the festival was a time to honor 
 deities as well as ancestors. Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the
  celebration of the Chinese New Year vary widely. Often, the evening preceding Chinese New
   Year's Day is an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. 
   It is also traditional for every family to thoroughly cleanse the house, in order to 
   sweep away any ill-fortune and to make way for good incoming luck. Windows and doors 
   will be decorated with red color paper-cuts and couplets with popular themes of "good 
   fortune" or "happiness", "wealth", and "longevity". Other activities include lighting 
   firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes.
